Yea all donation info is publicly available at the NCDOE website. 
https://www.ncsbe.gov/Campaign-Finance

Usually, candidates file quarterly, but the dates for NC don't always line up
 with the federal dates (just a heads up). 

Two weeks before an election and then 48 hours before there are also special 
reports....to prevent people from taking large chunks of cash wihtout disclosure 
at the end. Also I think anything above 1000 in the last week has to be reported 
immediately. But that is all posted on the website. 

The key thing you'll need to do is sort the PAC's and individual 
contributions....sometimes more easily done than not. Also, some of the campaigns
 don't submit electronic forms that integrate with their donation software so 
 these are photocopied pages that are turned into a PDF, possibly making it 
 difficult to scrape. 

Look to OpenSecrets.com as a model. Also look at this site. http://www.carolinatransparency.com/

------

historically, the annual reports would make sense....like if u were tracking 
insurance industry donations to legislators over time 

but during an election cycle, quarterly reports are the name of the game

after the quarters end, campaigns sometimes send releases to reporters to 
generate favorable coverage about their numbers (if they are good); smart 
reporters will make a calendar note and write a story regardless of whether 
they are reached out....so dropping an industry donation analysis right after
 a report drops to some reporters would be valuable i think
