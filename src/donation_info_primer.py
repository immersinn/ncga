Yea all donation info is publicly available at the NCDOE website. https://www.ncsbe.gov/Campaign-Finance

Usually, candidates file quarterly, but the dates for NC don't always line up with the federal dates (just a heads up). 

Two weeks before an election and then 48 hours before there are also special reports....to prevent people from taking large chunks of cash wihtout disclosure at the end. Also I think anything above 1000 in the last week has to be reported immediately. But that is all posted on the website. 

The key thing you'll need to do is sort the PAC's and individual contributions....sometimes more easily done than not. Also, some of the campaigns don't submit electronic forms that integrate with their donation software so these are photocopied pages that are turned into a PDF, possibly making it difficult to scrape. 

Look to OpenSecrets.com as a model. Also look at this site. http://www.carolinatransparency.com/
